# Katie Mangan Portfolio

This site displays a few individual and also group projects that I have completed during my time at Prime Digital Academy. In addition to a projects page, there is an Admin page that allows the user to add new projects or delete existing projects that are on the DOM.

All information is saved to a database named "portfolio" which includes two tables: projects and tags. 

This project uses React and Redux.
